# K Parser

## What is this

A WIP parser, written in Rust, for the Kotlin Programming Language. 

The main feature for this is to build Abstract Syntax Trees for a potential Kotlin LSP.

## What I want this to be

Kotlin doesn't have a lot of support, outside of the jetbrains ecosystem, in editors such as VSCode or Neovim. I hope to remedy that.
