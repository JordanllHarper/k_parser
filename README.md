# Kotlin Parser

## What this is 

This is a WIP project for creating an AST (abstract syntax tree) parser for the kotlin programming language. 

## What this aims to be

This is part of my own personal learning journey into learning about compilers and using one of my favourite languages to do so! 

It is also has the potential to provide apis for a Kotlin LSP inside of editors such as Neovim.
